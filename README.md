## AI

1) Take the original test data and fill in missing data using MissForest py module
2) Validate the data using Isolation Forest
   "It builds random decision trees. Anomalies are easier to "isolate" (they require fewer splits in the tree), making them stand out from the normal clusters." - gemini
3) Build an AI that learns from this data and generates 10k new lines
4) Validate synthetic data
5) Combine 581 og data and 9500 synthetic data to get the final data set of **10,081**
